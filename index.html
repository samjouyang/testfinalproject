    <!-- Introduction: The Challenge -->
    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>The Challenge: Gravity's Constant Pull</h2>
      <p>
        When you rise from a seated or lying position, gravity pulls blood downward toward your feet. This creates an immediate physiological challenge: blood that was flowing easily to your brain suddenly gets pulled away, potentially reducing cerebral blood flow by up to 20%.
      </p>
      <p>
        This momentary drop can cause that familiar lightheadedness or dizziness—a phenomenon called orthostatic hypotension. For most healthy individuals, this feeling passes quickly as your body activates a remarkable cascade of compensatory mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our study captured this dynamic process in real-time, measuring blood pressure, brain blood flow, and respiratory patterns as participants moved from sitting to standing and back again. Let's explore how your body maintains balance despite this gravitational challenge.

    <section id="time-series-explorer" class="scroll-section">
      <h2>Real-Time Response: The First 30 Seconds</h2>
      <p>
        Within seconds of standing, your blood pressure temporarily drops as gravity pulls blood away from your head. Your brain detects this change almost instantly through specialized pressure sensors (baroreceptors) in your blood vessels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watch below as we visualize the real-time changes in blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV) in both hemispheres of the brain. Notice the brief dip followed by a rapid recovery—this is your body's compensatory response in action.

      <h2>Three Critical Phases: Rest, Stand, Sit</h2>

        Your body's response to positional changes isn't uniform—it adapts differently during each phase of movement. By comparing these phases, we can better understand how your cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems work together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each transition represents a unique physiological challenge that requires different compensatory mechanisms:

        <p><strong>Stand-Up Phase (1860-1920s):</strong> Upon standing, your body activates multiple compensatory mechanisms—your heart rate increases, blood vessels constrict, and your breathing pattern may change to help stabilize blood pressure.</p>
        <p><strong>Sit-Down Phase (1920-1980s):</strong> When sitting back down, your body must readjust again as blood flow patterns reverse, sometimes causing a temporary blood pressure spike before returning to baseline.</p>

      <p>
        Blood pressure and cerebral blood flow are intimately connected, but their relationship isn't always straightforward. Your brain has a remarkable ability called "cerebral autoregulation" that helps maintain consistent blood flow despite changes in blood pressure.

        This visualization reveals how these two vital measurements interact during positional changes. By exploring different variable combinations, you can discover how your body's systems work together to protect brain function.

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>The Remarkable Balance: Your Body's Hidden Resilience</h2>
      <p>
        Every time you stand up, your body orchestrates a complex physiological response involving your heart, blood vessels, lungs, and brain. This intricate dance happens automatically, without conscious effort, protecting your brain from potentially dangerous drops in blood flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most healthy individuals, this system works flawlessly. However, understanding these mechanisms can help explain why some people experience dizziness upon standing—particularly older adults, those on certain medications, or individuals with autonomic nervous system disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
        This exploration reveals just one example of your body's remarkable resilience—a constant balancing act that maintains homeostasis despite the challenges of gravity and positional changes. By visualizing these hidden processes, we gain appreciation for the sophisticated regulatory systems that keep us functioning every day.
